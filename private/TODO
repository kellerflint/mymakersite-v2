Things I need to fix before production:
1. Either get rid of emails and figure out another way to do login and passwords, or ensure the security
2. Progress (i.e. badges) should display the required badges before the not required badges
3. Figure out and implement a way to link styles to badges
4. Add and delete sessions and edit session data

Before Full Beta Release:
1. Fix permissions not reloading after updating them
2. Improve overall style of websites, at least for users, ideally for everyone
3. Add more complex and interesting styles and css animations for user's profiles
4. Ensure security of email addresses and passwords
5. Fix GET security flaws where managers, admins and owners can edit and delete badges, 
users, ranks, etc for sessions other than their own editing html in forms.
6. Implement password resetting and account verification over email.
7. Implement payment method (optional, depends on if it's going to be open or 
closed beta testing but high use would be kind of expeinsive for me so I don't really want to go completely free)
8. Upload custom images for badges
9. Implement adding, removing and editing ranks
10. Finish validation functions for everything. Only have it for create and update user right now.
